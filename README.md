# formBuilder

## What it is
formBuilder is a project that provides a concise, reusable solution for creating and managing web forms. It is designed to let developers and product teams define form structure and behavior in a clear, maintainable way—whether programmatically or via configuration—so forms can be rendered, validated, and updated consistently across an application.

## Role
The role of formBuilder is to streamline and standardize form creation and lifecycle management. It reduces repetitive UI and validation work, enforces consistent form behavior and accessibility patterns, and accelerates iteration by separating form definition from presentation. As a centralized form tool, it helps teams prototype faster, maintain predictable user interactions, and integrate form data handling into larger applications with less overhead.
